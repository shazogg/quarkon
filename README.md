# quarkon
Quarkon is a new programming language

## Goals
The main goal of the language is to be a language that run on web browsers and servers to replace js, html, css but also to run on embedded systems.
To do that the language will have a lot of features that will make it easier to develop web applications.
For exemple, the language will use widgets to create the interface of the application, the widgets are similar to html tags but with more features.

## Runtime

You can get the runtime at [quarkon-runtime](https://github.com/shazogg/quarkon-runtime)

## Notes

- I'm a student, not an expert, so if there's a problem or anything, I'd love to hear from you.

- In the future, the Lexer and Parser will also be written in Rust.
