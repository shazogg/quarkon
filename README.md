# quarkon
Quarkon is a new programming language

currently the interpreter is developed in python but the final version will be written in rust

The main goal of the language is to be a language that run on web browsers and servers to replace js, html, css.
To do that the language will have a lot of features that will make it easier to develop web applications.
For exemple, the language use widgets to create the interface of the application, the widgets are similar to html tags but with more features.

Note: I'm a student, not an expert, so if there's a problem or anything, I'd love to hear from you.
